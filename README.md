# Caterpillar-Machine-Learning
# This project is part of the initiatives of the Natural History Museum of the University of Los Llanos and is carried out with the support of the research groups ENTOMOS and BIORINOQUIA. Its main objective is to explore the use of machine learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks, to automatically identify and describe the color patterns present on the wings of lepidopterans. Through the training of the YOLOv8 model with high-resolution labeled images, the project aims to advance toward the automatic generation of phenotypic descriptions by recognizing spots, bands, antennae, and other relevant morphological structures.
